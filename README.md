# Project: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in R
-------------------------
## Introduction 

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a data-set. EDA is an approach/philosophy for data analysis that employs a variety of techniques (mostly graphical) to:

* __maximize insight into a data-set__
* __uncover underlying structure__
* __extract important variables__
* __detect outliers and anomalies__
* __test underlying assumptions__
* __develop parsimonious models__
* __determine optimal factor settings__

## Getting Started

There is one dataset, student performance, downloaded from  https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams. The analysis starts with understanding the individual variables in the data-set, and ultimately proceeded to a bi-variate and multivariate analysis. 

## Prerequisites

R is the environment utilized with the addition of the following libraries:

* __DAAG__
* __MASS__
* __caret__
* __ggpubr__
* __ggplot2__
* __corrplot__
* __knitr__
* __tidyverse__
* __reshape__
* __memisc__
* __magrittr__
* __kableExtra__
* __DataExplorer__
* __GGally__
* __gridExtra__
* __tidyverse__
* __caret__
* __glmnet__

## Deployment

* **r_proj.Rmd**:  RMD file created using RStudio, an open-source Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the R programming language.
